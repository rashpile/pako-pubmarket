# External Code Review

Multi-phase code review system using external AI models (Claude, Codex, and Gemini) with parallel specialized agents. Inspired by the [ralphex](https://github.com/umputun/ralphex) autonomous review pipeline.

## Prerequisites

Install and configure these CLI tools:

- **claude** - [Claude CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude-code) (Anthropic) - required
- **codex** - [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) (OpenAI) - optional
- **gemini** - [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) (Google) - optional, fallback when codex unavailable

## Configuration

Optional config file at `~/.claude/external-code-review/config.json`:

```json
{
  "claude_model": "sonnet",
  "codex_model": "gpt-5.2-codex",
  "gemini_model": "",
  "external_tool": "auto"
}
```

All fields are optional — omit to use defaults.

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `claude_model` | CLI default | Model for `claude` CLI (`--model` flag) |
| `codex_model` | CLI default | Model for `codex` CLI |
| `gemini_model` | CLI default | Model for `gemini` CLI (`-m` flag) |
| `external_tool` | `auto` | Which external tool to use: `auto`, `codex`, or `gemini` |

**External tool resolution (`auto` mode):**
1. Try Codex CLI first
2. If Codex is not installed, fall back to Gemini CLI
3. If user explicitly asks for gemini (e.g., "review with gemini"), use Gemini regardless

Set `external_tool` to `codex` or `gemini` to skip auto-detection and always use a specific tool.

## Quick Start

**Important:** You must be on a feature branch with changes compared to the base branch.

```bash
# 1. Make sure you're on a feature branch (not main/master)
git branch --show-current

# 2. If on main, create a feature branch first
git checkout -b review/code-review-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# 3. Run full review pipeline
python scripts/run_review.py full --branch main --goal "Feature X implementation"

# Quick review (final phase only - 2 agents, critical/major issues)
python scripts/run_review.py quick --branch main --goal "Feature X implementation"

# Run individual phases
python scripts/run_review.py first --branch main
python scripts/run_review.py codex --branch main
python scripts/run_review.py final --branch main

# Generate summary report
python scripts/run_review.py report
```

## Review Phases

### Phase 1: First Review (5 Agents)

Launches 5 specialized agents **in parallel**:

| Agent | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **quality** | Bugs, security vulnerabilities, race conditions, error handling |
| **implementation** | Goal achievement, requirement coverage, integration completeness |
| **testing** | Test coverage, test quality, fake test detection, edge cases |
| **simplification** | Over-engineering, excessive abstraction, premature optimization |
| **documentation** | README updates, CLAUDE.md, breaking changes |

### Phase 2: External Review (Codex or Gemini)

- External tool (Codex or Gemini) analyzes code in sandbox mode
- Auto-detects available tool: codex first, gemini fallback. Use `--external-tool gemini` to force Gemini.
- Provides independent perspective from a different model family
- Claude evaluates findings with three-path logic:
  - **Valid issues found** → fix them, loop re-runs external tool to verify
  - **All findings dismissed** → loop re-runs with dismissal context to avoid re-reporting
  - **External tool found nothing** → commit fixes, done

### Phase 3: Final Review (2 Agents)

- Only **quality** and **implementation** agents
- Focuses on **critical/major issues only**
- Ignores style and minor issues

## Signal-Based Completion

The review script (`run_review.py`) and the Claude CLI prompts communicate through signal strings. The script launches `claude -p "<prompt>"` as a subprocess, captures stdout, and scans it for specific signal strings to decide whether to keep iterating or stop.

| Signal | Meaning | Script action |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| `<<<REVIEW_DONE>>>` | Zero issues found this iteration | Stop loop — review is clean |
| `<<<CODEX_REVIEW_DONE>>>` | External tool found no issues | Stop loop — external review done |
| `<<<REVIEW_FAILED>>>` | Issues found but cannot be fixed | Stop loop — needs human help |
| No signal | Issues were found and fixed | Continue loop — re-verify fixes |

The prompts tell Claude exactly when to emit each signal:

- **Path A** — no issues found → output `<<<REVIEW_DONE>>>`
- **Path B** — issues found and fixed → stop, no signal (loop runs again to verify)
- **Path C** — issues found but can't fix → output `<<<REVIEW_FAILED>>>`

`REVIEW_DONE` means "found zero issues", NOT "finished fixing". If issues were fixed, the loop continues to verify the fixes didn't introduce new problems.

## CLI Options

```bash
python scripts/run_review.py <phase> [options]

Phases:
  first       Run first review (5 agents)
  codex       Run Codex external review
  final       Run final review (2 agents)
  full        Run complete pipeline (first → codex → final)
  quick       Run quick review (final phase only — 2 agents, critical/major)
  report      Generate summary report

Options:
  --branch, -b        Base branch for diff (default: main)
  --goal, -g          Description of what was implemented
  --max-iterations, -i  Max review iterations (default: 10)
  --no-codex          Disable external review (Codex/Gemini)
  --codex-model       Codex model override (default: codex default)
  --external-tool     External tool: auto (default), codex, or gemini
  --gemini-model      Gemini model override (default: gemini default)
  --timeout, -t       Timeout per Claude call in seconds (default: 120)
```

## Workflow

1. **Get context**: `git diff` and `git log` against base branch
2. **Launch agents**: All agents run in parallel via Task tool
3. **Collect findings**: Merge and deduplicate across agents
4. **Verify each finding**: Read actual code to confirm (not false positive)
5. **Fix confirmed issues**: Apply changes
6. **Run tests + linter**: Verify fixes don't break anything
7. **Commit**: `git commit -m "fix: address code review findings"`
8. **Loop**: Continue until zero issues found

## Agent Definitions

Each agent has a specific focus area defined in `agents/*.txt`:

- **quality.txt** - Correctness, security, simplicity assessment
- **implementation.txt** - Requirement coverage, wiring, completeness
- **testing.txt** - Coverage gaps, test quality, fake test detection
- **simplification.txt** - Abstraction layers, premature generalization
- **documentation.txt** - README, CLAUDE.md, plan file updates

## Customization

### Custom Agents

Edit files in `agents/` to modify review focus areas.

### Custom Prompts

Edit files in `prompts/` to change the review workflow:

- `review_first.txt` - Modify which agents run or how findings are processed
- `external_eval.txt` - Change how external tool findings are evaluated
- `review_final.txt` - Adjust final review criteria

## Example Session

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/user-auth

# ... implement feature ...

# Run full review
python scripts/run_review.py full \
  --branch main \
  --goal "User authentication with JWT tokens"

# Output:
# 🔍 Starting FULL REVIEW pipeline
# 📋 Starting FIRST REVIEW phase (5 agents)
# 🔄 First review iteration 1/10
# 🧠 Running Claude review...
# ... agent findings ...
# ✅ First review complete - no issues found!
# 🤖 Starting EXTERNAL REVIEW phase (Codex)
# ... external analysis ...
# ✅ Codex review complete!
# 🎯 Starting FINAL REVIEW phase (2 agents)
# ... final verification ...
# ✅ Final review complete - no critical issues!
# 🎉 FULL REVIEW pipeline complete!
```

## Notes

- Pre-existing issues (linter errors, failed tests) are fixed too
- Codex runs in read-only sandbox for safety
- Each iteration verifies previous fixes didn't introduce new issues
- Tests and linter must pass after each fix batch
